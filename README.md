so all the php files and folders namely:-

partials
_dbconnect.php
login.php
signup.php
welcome.php

2. To control Apache server and MySQL using XAMPP Control Panel v3.3.0 

Apache server is for loaclhost.
we can use any browser and type -> localhost/sunil/
so it will open the project signup.php -> enter user dynamic data
or user can directly with the help of email and password from -> login.php

MySQL is used for DataBase storage and having 4 fields as:

 1. Email
